# JavaScript Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small JavaScript practice exercises and mini-projects. Each folder focuses on one concept and is kept self-contained for easy review. Many of these are based on the [CS50 Web - JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/notes/5/), along with additional experiments as I progress.

## Concepts Covered
- DOM Manipulation & UI Interactions
- Event Handling
- Conditionals & Basic Logic
- Forms & Input Validation
- Timers (`setInterval`, `setTimeout`)
- Local Storage for Persistent State
- Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, `async` / `await`)
- Fetch API / AJAX for retrieving external data


## Folder Structure

```
js-practice/
  ├─ project-name/
  │   ├─ index.html
  │   ├─ script.js
  │   └─ style.css  (optional)
  └─ another-project/
```

Each project is fully self-contained to make the code easy to read and evaluate individually.

## Projects
| Project Name | Concept Demonstrated | Status |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| popup-example | UI interaction & DOM updates | ✅ |
| counter-with-intervals | Timers (`setInterval` / `setTimeout`) | ⬜ |
| color-change-button | Event handling | ⬜ |
| todo-list | Form input + validation | ⬜ |
| currency-converter-fetch | Fetch API + `async/await` (AJAX request) | ⬜ |

> The project list will be updated as new exercises are completed.

### How to Add a New Project
1. mkdir project-name
2. cd project-name
3. touch index.html script.js style.css

## Purpose
The goal here is to get more comfortable writing **vanilla JavaScript** and working directly with the browser DOM, instead of relying on frameworks. These small projects help reinforce core concepts by building things from scratch.
